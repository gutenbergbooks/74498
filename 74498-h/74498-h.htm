<h4><span class="smcap">Characters</span></h4>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Father Time</span> and the <span class="smcap">Twelve Months of the Year</span>.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Costumes</span>, etc.: <span class="smcap">Time</span>, an emblematic figure; <span class="smcap">Months</span>
dressed according to characters: <span class="smcap">January</span> wears a
mask at back of head, resembling face; <span class="smcap">February</span> is
the shortest child, and walks with a skipping leap at
every fourth step; <span class="smcap">March’s</span> costume suggests the
lion and the lamb, etc. Scenery may be elaborate, or
simple, or dispensed with entirely. A sun-dial or a
clump of rocks may be placed at back of stage, where
<span class="smcap">Time</span> will take his position while the Months recite.
Snow may be simulated by small pieces of white paper
being gently dropped from above, or by a little salt
being placed in the folds of a character’s coat, so
that it drops off lightly, or by a frosty little dab of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
soap-suds on the shoulder melting almost immediately.
Taking a commanding position <span class="smcap">Time</span> will
summon each Month in turn by name, through a
megaphone, then when the Month appears will retire
to the back of stage till the recitation shall have been
concluded. The Months will appear when summoned,
in turn, disappearing on the opposite side of
stage, if possible behind a piece of scenery, reappearing
at back of stage, there to remain quietly till the
ensemble at close. Appropriate music for exits and
entrances may be used. The songs and dances may be
arranged to popular tunes. Colored lights if skilfully
handled may be used.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Music</span>: It ends with heavy chords marking time. Curtain
rises disclosing <span class="smcap">Father Time</span>. He blows blast
through megaphone, then speaks.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i><span class="smcap">Valentinus</span>, a priest of the Christian Church in Rome.</i></p>

<p class="hanging"><i><span class="smcap">Asterius</span>, chief officer of the Prefect Calpurnius.</i></p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Time</span>: <i>The fourteenth of February [the sixteenth day before
the Kalends of March] during the reign of the
Roman Emperor Claudius II [A. D. 268-270].</i></p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>A room in the town house of <span class="smcap">Asterius</span>. The
scene shows a room furnished in Roman style, but
plainly, with table, chair, bench and stool. High up
on one wall is an aperture with wooden shutters, now
open to admit light and air. Through this window
may be seen the branches of a tree, bare of leaf, yet
with buds swelling, and a glimpse of sky. In the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
same wall is a door which gives exit to the lane at the
back of the house. On the other side is a curtained
opening to another room.... On the table are writing
materials of the kind in use at the time. Seated so
as to catch the light <span class="smcap">Valentinus</span> is busily engaged
in writing. Enter <span class="smcap">Nerva</span> bearing a jar of steaming
pottage, with a spoon, also a platter with a square,
flat cake of bread.</i></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Nerva.</span></p>

<p>Behold, your supper, Valentinus! [<i>He sets down his
burden.</i>] Supper, I say. And though but prisoner’s
fare, yet, through some bewitchment you exercise over the
entire household, myself excepted, seasoned with the cook’s
best art! [<i>He sniffs the pottage.</i>] M-m-m!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Quartilla.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Head between the curtains.</i>] Bo!... Valentinus!
Tilla says Bopeep!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>Ah, my little Quartilla! One sixtieth portion of an hour
and I shall have done!... [<i>Still engrossed with work.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Quartilla.</span></p>

<p>Sh! [<i>She enters on tiptoe, and one sees that she is an
attractive child.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Nerva.</span></p>

<p>What have you there, Quartilla? [<i>He tries to help himself
from a basket of dainties she carries.</i>] What, cheese
cakes, almond cakes, and little tarts! M-m-m!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Quartilla.</span></p>

<p>Nerva! Audacious one, forbear! These are for Valentinus!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Nerva.</span></p>

<p>Wasted on him, when all day he does nothing but spoil
good parchment with the juice of the cuttle-fish, only pausing
to mend his split reed, or erase a mark with pumice-stone!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Quartilla.</span></p>

<p>He writes words of comfort to his afflicted people whom
our godlike Emperor thinks fit to persecute!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Nerva.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Devouring a tart.</i>] Persecute! By the immortal gods
I like such persecution!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Quartilla.</span></p>

<p>Peace, brazen one! [<i>She goes to the curtains.</i>] Enter,
Pertinax, and gaze on our distinguished guest!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Nerva.</span></p>

<p>Distinguished guest! A jail-bird whom the jail is too
full to hold, and so committed by the Prefect Calpurnius
to the care of my master, Asterius, and in his absence to
mine! Distinguished guest, forsooth!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Enters, a manly young fellow of pleasing personality.
His arms are full of flowering branches, also he carries a
basket of flowers.</i>] So this is Quartilla’s wizard!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Nerva.</span></p>

<p>Quartilla’s wizard, everybody’s wizard. Well may you
say so! How else but by wizardry do you account for Asterius
sending him dainties from his own table ... Asterius
who seals up the very salt-cellar in his thrift!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Quartilla.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Laughs.</i>] Hush! That is my secret! I steal them
for him! Though I present them to him with my father’s
greetings, else, so honest is he, he would make me put them
back! [<i>The <span class="smcap">Others</span> exclaim.</i>] Yet, do you know, sometimes
I fancy my father sees the theft, but turns his head
aside!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Nerva.</span></p>

<p>Magic! [<i>Going.</i>] By the gods and goddesses, why am
not I a Christian and a prisoner!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Laying work aside.</i>] These lengthening days tempt
me to prolong work! Now, Tilla; is it a doll to be
mended, or a table in weights and measures to be learned,
or.... [<i>He pauses, seeing <span class="smcap">Pertinax</span>.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Quartilla.</span></p>

<p>This is Pertinax, overseer at my father’s farm!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>Greetings to you, Pertinax!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>And to you kindly, Valentinus. May the blessing of
the gods be to you as a plenteous year’s harvest! [<i>He sets
down his burden.</i>] Though I am told that you Christians
no longer believe in our ancient gods of Rome!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>But we believe in blessings, from whatever source!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>That lies beyond my comprehension. But then, I am
told, you work miracles!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Quartilla.</span></p>

<p>Indeed he does! He has mended my doll’s nose, and
made me remember how many quarts of water you can
pour into an amphora!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Nerva.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Entering with an amphora of water while she speaks.</i>]
As if anyone could not do as much!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Quartilla.</span></p>

<p>None other has ever done it, all the same!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Nerva.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Arms akimbo.</i>] Come, then, wizard; prove yourself!
dispose for us some prodigy!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>What, Nerva, would you consider such?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Nerva.</span></p>

<p>Oh, that a hen should crow, or a black dog should suddenly
bound through the room, or a snake come down the
pipe into the cistern, or that the statue of Jupiter should
laugh!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>None of which things can I bring to pass! Nor do I
call them miracles!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i><span class="smcap">Nerva</span> laughs, sneering.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>How, sir, do you define a miracle?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Quartilla.</span></p>

<p>Instruct them, Valentinus! Give them proof!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rolling up his parchment, thoughtfully.</i>] Hm! Well,
then, will you, Pertinax, and you, Nerva, walk a few paces
from me toward the door?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Quartilla.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Dancing with joy.</i>] A proof! A demonstration!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>Not so! Merely a definition!... Toward the door!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Nerva.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Mocking, though complying.</i>] Which, no doubt, will
fly open of its own accord at our approach!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>The <span class="smcap">Two</span> comply, walking toward the door.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Quartilla.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Dancing about.</i>] Now you’ll see; you’ll see!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>With his rolled parchment <span class="smcap">Valentinus</span> gives each
youth a sharp blow across the shoulders. With an
indignant cry they turn about.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>Now, by Hercules...!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Nerva.</span></p>

<p>May Castor and Pollux rend me if I see...!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Mildly.</i>] Did you feel that blow, Pertinax?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>By Hercules, how should I not do so!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>Ah! And you, Nerva?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Nerva.</span></p>

<p>By Castor and Pollux, am I a stone!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>Ah! Well, it would have been a miracle if you had not
felt it!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>The <span class="smcap">Two</span> look rather discomfited, then <span class="smcap">Pertinax</span>
laughs, seeing the humour of it, while <span class="smcap">Nerva</span> goes,
crest-fallen.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Quartilla.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Recovering from delighted mirth.</i>] Oh, that was
lovely! But, come, now. Pertinax has a secret to confide
in you. Meanwhile eat your supper. It is past the ninth
hour, and all day you have worked fasting! Oh, not that
bread! My father’s greetings and will you partake of this!
[<i>Substitutes fine bread from her basket for that which
<span class="smcap">Nerva</span> has brought, whereon <span class="smcap">Nerva</span> at the curtains
coughs.</i>] Now, Pertinax! What, bashful? Then I’ll
tell! He writes poetry! Beautiful poetry!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Modestly, though flattered.</i>] Oh, modest strophes that
call for an indulgent ear! Numbers whose measures course
through my brain while I superintend the pruning and
grafting, the ploughing and planting! As for instance,
by your leave! [<i>Taking out a scroll he reads.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Quartilla.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rapturously.</i>] Is it not heavenly?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>Truly it has ever been a favourite of mine since in my
schoolboy days I conned my Anacreon! [<i><span class="smcap">Pertinax</span> looks
discomfited, <span class="smcap">Quartilla</span> sympathetic, while <span class="smcap">Nerva</span>, looking
in at the curtains, bursts into peals of laughter.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Nerva.</span></p>

<p>Anacreon! By Momus, but that’s funny! Anacreon,
indeed, my poet!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Seizing on <span class="smcap">Nerva</span>.</i>] Shameless one than whom none
is more contemptible! To perdition with you! May the
gods give you your deserts! May you be buffeted with
fists, jerked with rods, pricked with goads, pinched with
red-hot tongs, roasted over a scorching fire, and thrown
to wild beasts to be devoured!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Nerva.</span></p>

<p>Help, help! Hercules, I invoke thy aid! Oh, I’m destroyed
utterly!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Quartilla.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Dancing for joy.</i>] Thumbs up! Don’t spare him,
Pertinax! Thumbs up! [<i>She presses her thumbs upward
in the manner of the spectators at a gladiatorial contest
when they wished the vanquished contestant to be
slain.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Interposing, rescues <span class="smcap">Nerva</span>.</i>] There, there! That is
punishment enough for youthful levity!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Sinks into a seat and wipes a heated brow.</i>] Levity?
No cork on water was ever of character more light! Had
I you under me at the farm ... [<i>Threatens <span class="smcap">Nerva</span> who
runs off.</i>] ... I’d change your tune!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Nerva.</span></p>

<p>[<i>As he goes, taunting.</i>] Anacreon! Ha, ha! Anacreon!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>Master, I confess to the theft of an older poet’s words,
but the feeling they clothe is all my own, generated here!
[<i>Hand on breast.</i>] Suffer me to explain! But, first,
Quartilla, leave us!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Quartilla.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Grumbling.</i>] As usual! Whenever things become interesting
it is, “Quartilla, leave us!”</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>How fares our sister Tertulla whom not since early
morning have I seen?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Quartilla.</span></p>

<p>Not well!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Starting up, agitated.</i>] What! Tertulla ... Asteria
Tertia ... she is ill?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Quartilla.</span></p>

<p>Oh, not ill! Tulla is sad. All day Tulla sits apart
and sighs, “Eheu! Woe is me!” And all because my
father has not taken her as usual to the country!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>Tertulla has fewer pleasures than those who can see!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Quartilla.</span></p>

<p>That is true! Wait! [<i>She has an inspiration.</i>] I
have a way to cheer her! I’ll tell her Pertinax is here!
[<i>About to go.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Greatly agitated.</i>] The gods forbid! Quartilla, if so
you do, never again will I pluck sweet pears for you and
grapes and pomegranates when you steal out to me in the
orchard!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Quartilla.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Teasing.</i>] See now how frightened he is! One would
think my poor sister to be accursed, the way he always
runs from her! However as I love sweet pears and grapes
and pomegranates I promise I won’t tell!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>The heavens reward you!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Quartilla.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Running off.</i>] I’ll make her guess it for herself!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Sighs.</i>] Eheu! Wretched I! Master ... [<i>He waxes
confidential.</i>] I have a secret! I love!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>In the springtime of your life and of the year why not?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>Why not, indeed! But.... There is a but!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>As always!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>But never was a but so insurmountable as mine!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>Again, as always!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>While occupying an enviable position as overseer of my
master’s farm I should be happier as a public slave working
in the stone-quarries or the mill! Worn to the heart
with longing I am of mortals the most wretched! I cannot
sleep, I cannot eat! [<i>Absent-mindedly he helps
himself to a little cake from <span class="smcap">Quartilla’s</span> basket and nibbles
it with relish.</i>] To such a degree has love inflamed
me that, but for my tears, I should be consumed with fire!
My wits wander like cows at pasture! No longer do I
remember when to sow the three months’ wheat, or how to
set out a rose-bed! A row of lilies or of leeks, it is all the
same to me! [<i>Sighs deeply.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>Not so, judging by the fruits of your husbandry! [<i>Indicating
the flowers.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>Ah-h! These are different! These are sacred blooms
... my source of inspiration! These come from Tertulla’s
garden!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Understanding the position.</i>] Hm! Tertulla!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Corroborating.</i>] Even so! Tertulla! I have looked
with inclination on the maid from the day when I, a by-standing
youth, drew her from the reach of the fateful
flames of her mother’s funeral pile into which in her grief
she was about to cast herself ... an act of filial piety
which, combined with excessive weeping, cost her the sight
of her lovely eyes! When, rewarding me, Asterius purchased
me, I rejoiced in the exchange of masters, for the
opportunity this would afford me constantly to behold my
divinity-on-earth! I have watched her grow like the sapling
trees under my care ... and with her growth and
mine my love has kept apace! The garden she calls her
own have I made my especial care, tending it not only
by day, but also by night when none might guess my secret,
till the fame of Tertulla’s garden is a proverb! [<i>He
pauses a second for breath.</i>] To me she is the breath of
life! But.... Eheu! Woe’s me!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>You fear the opposition of Asterius?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>That, doubtless, would be terrible, since, when roused,
he blusters like the Adriatic in a storm! However, the
more violent the tempest, the shorter-lived! With your
all-powerful intercession, Valentinus, Asterius might be
reconciled! He might suffer me with my hoardings to
buy my freedom, and since, through the merits of the gods
and of my ancestors, my name is no less honourable than
his own, and since no wooers besiege his door for his blind
daughter he might be brought to look with favour on me
as a son-in-law! Lies not the trouble there!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>Then where?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>With Tertulla! With the maid herself!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>You mean she holds you in aversion!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>Worse, worse! O by a thousand times worse! Myself
as Pertinax she hardly knows, hardly ever has thrown a
word to, yet she loves me! More, she worships me!...<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
She thinks me an emissary from the immortal gods, if not,
indeed, myself a god!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>You offer riddles to one called Valentinus, not Œdipus!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>Let me unravel it that you may extricate me from the
sacrilegious maze in which, all-unheeding, I, wretchedest
of men, have lost myself!... Thus did it begin!...
But, hark! [<i>Voices are heard in the adjoining room.</i>]
She comes! Tertulla!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>In great perturbation he hastily opens the door and
passes out.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Maronis.</span></p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Maronis</span> and <span class="smcap">Quartilla</span> leading <span class="smcap">Tertulla</span>,
a young girl of great beauty. Her hair hangs
loose, she wears a chaplet and a white, flowing robe;
also her feet are bare, or sandaled. Her general
aspect is of one prepared to offer sacrifice. Her
eyes are bandaged, and her countenance and voice
are sad.</i>]</p>

thus deject of countenance?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Quartilla.</span></p>

<p>I know why!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>Peace, Tilla! At your age how should one comprehend
such matters?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Quartilla.</span></p>

<p>Does one have to be tall as a fig-tree to know that you
are bursting with longing for your garden? “Eheu!
wretchedest of women I as many as ever have been born!
Woe’s me!” [<i>Mimicking her sister.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Maronis.</span></p>

<p>It is true. If it were not for the bandage that you,
Valentinus, make her wear she would weep so immoderately
that she would be turned into a river, like to Ilia, the
mother of Romulus and Remus!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Explaining.</i>] Always, ever since I was a child, in the
days that cut the month of February in twain my father
has taken me with him to the country, journeying thither
to give directions for the spring work at his farm. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
this year, business detaining him in town, he has sent for
his overseer to come here to him, instead, and so ...
Eheu!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>But the year is young. Barely have the heavens ceased
to scatter snow on the Albanian hills. As yet the relaxing
earth suffers only the hardiest of her green children to put
their noses out of bed! Later you will all go to your
father’s villa, avoiding the scorching heat of dog-star days!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>Ah, then it will not be the same! Then will it be too
late.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Puzzled.</i>] Too late?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Maronis.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Explaining.</i>] If you were not a deserving but unfortunate
Christian, Valentinus, you would not have forgotten
that in the days about the Ides of February the
young god Faunus, protector of those same green children
of the earth, returns from his winter quarters in Arcadia
to Italy!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Remembering.</i>] Ah, true! Nevertheless.... [<i>Still
puzzled.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Maronis.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Continuing.</i>] And Tertulla is wonted to celebrate the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
feast of the Faunalia at the villa, offering sacrifice in her
garden to the two-horned god!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>It is indeed so!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i><span class="smcap">Pertinax</span> opens the door softly a crack and peeps in,
seen only by <span class="smcap">Valentinus</span>.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>I begin to understand! Well, since Tertulla cannot go
to the country perhaps the country will come to Tertulla!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Quartilla.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Dancing about gleefully.</i>] A miracle! A prodigy!
I said Valentinus would work one and set things right!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>My child, I promise nothing! But Tertulla must remember
that true sacrifices can be made anywhere, in country
or in town!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Maronis.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To <span class="smcap">Tertulla</span>.</i>] Aha, girl! Have I not worn out my
tongue telling you as much all day?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>But will the god hear, missing me from my accustomed
place?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>No honest petition ever goes unheeded anywhere!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Maronis.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Nodding approval.</i>] Another statement of my own,
and therefore full of wisdom!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To <span class="smcap">Valentinus</span>.</i>] Oh, how you comfort me! And
yet ... there is something further!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Quartilla.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Excited.</i>] Aha! A secret!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>But not for your ears, O little pitcher of two handles!
Go from us awhile!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Quartilla.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Pouting.</i>] As usual when things grow interesting:
“Quartilla, leave us!” But this time Valentinus will have
to use magic to make me budge!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>Alas! No sorcerer am I! Yet, perhaps.... Hark!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Quartilla.</span></p>

<p>What do you hear?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>Surely not the first swallow, returning on the wings of
the bird-wind, and seeking where to build a nest! Up,
Tilla! Let us see! [<i>Mounting the bench he draws her
up, then lifts her to the window.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Quartilla.</span></p>

<p>Oh, the wee darling, flitting from plane to cypress, cypress
back to plane! And, see! There goes a man with
a ring-dove in a cage! Come, Maronis! We’ll go buy it
of him! [<i>Assisted by <span class="smcap">Valentinus</span> she scrambles down
and runs out into the lane.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Maronis.</span></p>

<p>Oh, what a runabout! I should have wings to my feet
like Mercury to keep up with her! [<i>She follows <span class="smcap">Quartilla</span>
out.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>Are we alone?... How wonderful you are! All your
perhapses come to pass!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>Perhaps I only “perhaps” when I see events well on
their advancing road!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>But never do they turn down a side street! Never do
they lose their way! Always they come, straight as a bow-shot,
to the door! Everyone else said, “Afflicted of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
gods for over-much grieving Tertulla will never see
again!” But you ... you said, “I promise nothing, yet
perhaps....” And, now, though you will not suffer me
to test it, I feel that my eyes have been born again; that I
can see!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>Hush!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>Oh, never fear; I will keep my vow, not, without your
permission, to reveal this to mortal ears! But I, I know
that so it is! Accordingly when you say, “Since Tertulla
cannot go to the country perhaps the country will come to
Tertulla,” I feel sure that, in spite of inauspicious beginnings,
all will yet be well! And indeed, strangely, ever
since I set foot in the room my nostrils have been filled
with the accustomed fragrances from my garden; my spirit
has received the message of spring from her harbingers:
the hardy rose, and early flowering almond; the branches
of a forth-putting cherry-tree on a sunny slope, and bloom
of narcissus and violet from the nurseries! But Faunus
... Faunus himself! Will he, as is his wont, reveal
himself in this place, to his handmaiden? That, Valentinus,
is my great secret! To no one heretofore have I disclosed it!
[<i>Again the door is cautiously opened, and <span class="smcap">Pertinax</span> peeps
in.</i>] Every year in these days the god Faunus himself
has accepted my sacrifice in person, promising me protection
for my flowers through the coming season, a promise
which has been miraculously redeemed! Work a wonder
for me, good Valentinus! Bring it to pass that the god
will reveal himself here, no less than in the country, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
his handmaiden! [<i><span class="smcap">Pertinax</span> enters softly; sighs.</i>]
What! do I hear his footstep cross the threshold with a
sound as of the favouring breeze of spring? Faunus!
Faunus! Do you see him, Valentinus? You could not
mistake him, with his youthful countenance of great
beauty, his two horns, and feet like those of a goat that he
may skip lightly over the hills!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>No such one is manifest to my sight, Tertulla!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>And yet ... and yet.... O Faunus, if indeed it be
you, speak! [<i>With palms turned upward.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Sighs.</i>] The one who always comes to you at this season
stands before you now, Tertulla!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Ecstatically.</i>] You hear! Valentinus! You hear?...
Mark then, how great the prodigy when the god
comes, invisible to mortal eyes! O Faunus, had I expected
this I would have brought the cheese and almond
cakes and little tarts you love!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>These shall not be wanting! [<i>Places <span class="smcap">Quartilla’s</span> basket
in <span class="smcap">Tertulla’s</span> hand.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>O happy omen! Deign to accept them, deity! [<i><span class="smcap">Pertinax</span>
helps himself from the basket.</i>] But you do not
partake of them as wontedly. [<i><span class="smcap">Pertinax</span>, encouraged
by a kindly smile from <span class="smcap">Valentinus</span>, eats.</i>] That is better!
Now Tertulla knows that you look on her with favour!
And my garden, Faunus; as heretofore you will
grant me abundance of bloom interspersed with grateful
shade of strawberry tree and sycamore? And linden dear
to honey-gathering bee?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>As heretofore, Tertulla!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>And my friends, the flowers: crocus, and anemone, and
the blossom springing from the blood of Hyacinth—?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Always eating little cakes, which <span class="smcap">Tertulla</span> keeps offering
him.</i>] These, and the twining ivy, source of poetic
inspiration!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>And viburnum, beloved of wayfarers, and sleep-bringing
poppies?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>And violet sweet-scented, and the short-lived lily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>And the amaranth the never-fading! You see he has
taught me all their habits and their stories, Valentinus!...
And the rose and myrtle beloved of Venus?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>These, these above all!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Clasping hand ecstatically.</i>] O wonderful!... And
the box trees cut into strange figures that I can pass my
hands over: centurions with eagles on their helmets?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>And chariots in the circus!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>And gladiators fighting?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>And the sharp prows of sea-conquering galleys!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>Is it not wonderful, Valentinus? But the god has
ceased to eat! Ah, Tertulla was forgetting! The libation!
[<i>Claps hands.</i>] Wine! Bring wine, Nerva!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Alarmed.</i>] It is not necessary, Tertulla!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>Nothing shall be omitted that pleases Faunus! Ho,
Nerva!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Nerva.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Appears between curtains.</i>] Nerva here, Nerva there!
Who calls Nerva now?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>Impudent and brazen one! Bring a goblet of honied
wine! My father’s best!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Nerva.</span></p>

<p>Wine! Honied wine! What next! [<i>He goes.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Who fled hastily at <span class="smcap">Nerva’s</span> approach.</i>] There are occasions
when one may dispense with such ceremonies!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>Nothing shall be lacking from the feast, not only as
propitiation for favours hoped for, but in gratitude for
benefits received! Bethink you how wonderful the scroll
you have spread out before me, painting the dark chambers
of my spirit with blossoms of many colours, and filling
my life with sweet savours, and with fancies no less sweet!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>Asteria Tertia, I speak truly in saying that at too high
a value do you estimate the service I, all-joyful, have
rendered you! Your own imagination divinely gifted is
the Apelles that has so pleasingly depicted the wonders
of nature, heightened, I grant you, by assiduous cultivation,
in a manner to adorn the chambers of your spirit!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>My imagination is even as my garden that had lain a
fallow waste fit only for the hunting ground of hoarse-baying
wolves had not Faunus taken it under his divine
protection!... And now this present miracle is indeed
reserved for me alone? You, keen-sighted Valentinus,
you do not mock me with vain words, saying that you do
not discern the form of the god? Not a single feature?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>Only as all created things are manifestations of the divine,
Tertulla!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>Marvelous! But wherefore tarries Nerva with the libation?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Nerva.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Entering.</i>] Here’s your wine! I had to climb up to
the wine-cellar to find a proper vintage! All mixed with
our choicest honey, too! [<i>As <span class="smcap">Pertinax</span> has retreated at
the sound of his voice he sees <span class="smcap">Tertulla</span> standing in an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
attitude of adoration before empty space, and pauses to
stare at her.</i>] Well, now, what project is the girl on now?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>Enter, Nerva, fearlessly! Your dull eyes will perceive
no unexpected presence!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Nerva.</span></p>

<p>Truly a clever speech! [<i>He sets down the goblet, lingering
to sniff at it.</i>] M-m-m! One would think certain
persons were soldiers celebrating the victory of the godlike
Claudius over Goths and Allemanes! By Bacchus, there
are times when I could wish myself a persecuted Christian!
[<i>He goes. <span class="smcap">Pertinax</span> returns.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Lifts the goblet from the table and holds it toward
<span class="smcap">Pertinax</span>.</i>] Take it, Faunus, from thy handmaiden!
[<i><span class="smcap">Pertinax</span> obeys, drinking the wine.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] Ahem! Not so were libations poured in
my ante-Christian days!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Explaining.</i>] Faunus likes it best that way rather
than spilled upon the ground!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>Not without reason! The vintage of Asterius is famed!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>And now, O Deity, listen, while I reveal to you my great
secret known only to Valentinus here!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Starting up, interposing.</i>] Tertulla, forbear! Remember
your vow!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Assenting.</i>] Not without your permission to tell any
living mortal! But....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>Then, till I give you leave, forbear!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Impetuously.</i>] But, Valentinus ... that will not be
breaking faith! Faunus is no mortal! Faunus is a god!
Faunus, he has cured me! Valentinus here has cured me!
I can see! I can see!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Impetuously she tears the bandage from her eyes.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Startled and terrified.</i>] What!... Ah, woe is me,
accursed of Jupiter and sport of men! [<i>Throwing away
the now emptied goblet he rushes out, by the door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Hands up to her dazzled eyes.</i>] Ah! The light!...
[<i><span class="smcap">Valentinus</span> restores the bandage, binding it gently on
again.</i>] Faunus!... What happened, Valentinus?...
Why did the god cry out? And has he gone? Eheu!
Oh, woe! Is he angry with poor Tertulla?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>Not angry; only taken by surprise!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>But surely he does not begrudge me vision! Surely
he believes that Tertulla seeing will serve him no less
faithfully than Tertulla blind!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Maronis.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Enters running, at the door.</i>] Tulla ... I heard
Tulla who cried out! Has aught befallen Tulla?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>It is nothing! Take her where she may rest awhile!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Maronis.</span></p>

<p>Come, then, my honeysuckle-sprig! Come with Maronis!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Quartilla.</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Breaks from <span class="smcap">Maronis</span>, returns to <span class="smcap">Valentinus</span>. Whispers.</i>]
Faunus ... you’ll seek him, and plead with him
for me?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>I promise nothing, but I’ll do my best!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Reassured.</i>] Ah, then, I know it will come out right!
[<i>She goes with <span class="smcap">Maronis</span> and <span class="smcap">Quartilla</span>.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Returns.</i>] O woe, woe! A plague may all the gods
and goddesses send upon you for a Thessalian sorcerer!
O gladly with these two hands would I choke you like a
noxious nettle and cast you out to extreme and uttermost
perdition, so abominably by our arts in restoring sight
to Tertulla have you destroyed my happiness!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>Is that word worthy of an incarnate god?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>You speak truly! Blameworthy am I alone! By my
impious and sacrilegious act I have upset my apple-waggon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
for all eternity! I am a wretch, one born with all
the gods my foes! [<i>He throws himself into a chair and
covers his face with his cloak.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Nerva.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Entering.</i>] Ho, Valentinus! Your company is much
demanded in these days it would seem! Maronis asks that
you will give a soothing potion to Tertulla who is restless
as the wind that blows between the old moon and the
new!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>Willingly! [<i>He goes.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Nerva.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Noticing the door which <span class="smcap">Pertinax</span> entering left ajar.</i>]
By Jupiter, for a prison we keep open house! [<i>Taking a

<p>Oh, if my conversation is not desired I will even stop
my mouth, so great my zeal to please! [<i>He helps himself
to little cakes. Suddenly the door is tried from without.</i>]
Hear that! My precaution was none too soon! [<i>There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
is a violent knocking on the door.</i>] Knock away, whoever

The door was locked too late, it seems!... Now, may the
gods be praised, for it grieves me to detain so holy a man
... in which I am more of a well-wisher to him than to
myself!... [<i><span class="smcap">Valentinus</span> enters.</i>] Not so, however, it

about to give the alarm, thinking you a fugitive!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Asterius.</span></p>

<p>A deserving fellow! I bought him, as you know, from
gratitude, but never have I repented me of the investment!
Never does he give orders to hoe the barley in wet weather
or cheat me in the number of elm and poplar saplings

impudent rascal Nerva, remission of all the floggings you

Also all the sweets you can stuff yourself with! As

<p>My blood, Asterius, is not ignoble! I was not bought

ones! [<i>Looking at <span class="smcap">Nerva</span> who is stifling his mirth

<p>Why, now, child, it is for this very thing you paid your
money ... to give it back its stolen happiness!... See,
already it lifts its drooping head ... ready to answer the
call of life, and spring, and love!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Quartilla.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Opening the door of the cage as she goes out.</i>] Farewell,

cubits long!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Asterius.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With contempt.</i>] Pertinax, forsooth! Come with me,
Quartilla! [<i><span class="smcap">Quartilla</span> goes with him.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Also with contempt.</i>] Pertinax, indeed! My father

<p>Who sighed then? Surely not Faunus! Surely Faunus

always counsel wisely! How can I propitiate the god, assuring
him of my continued loyal service?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>True service implies many things, Tertulla, among
which not the least is gratitude! Under the favour of
Heaven human hands were needed to protect the tender
roots from the cruelties of winter, to water them in days
of drought, and foster their growth! The miracle of the
god could be wrought only by the devotion of a man!</p>

Why ... yours was the last face I saw before my vision
went to sleep, when you, a boy, drew me from the reach of
the all-devouring flames! [<i>She turns aside with emotion.</i>]
An act but for which I should still be.... How unmindful
have I been all these years! But now ... you shall
find me not ungrateful!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>I ask nothing, Asteria Tertia, but pardon for the offence
of having lifted my own eyes toward you!... With the
freedom your Jove-like father has this day bestowed on me
I withdraw from his service, never to cross the threshold
of your life again!... Kindly fare-you-well! [<i>He turns
to go.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a little cry.</i>] Oh! But my garden!... Valentinus,
what, think you, would Faunus have me do with my
affairs in such case? [<i>In a whisper to <span class="smcap">Valentinus</span>.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Valentinus.</span></p>

<p>What does your own heart counsel you, Tertulla? [<i>He
places in her hand a blossoming spray.</i>] Close your eyes

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Tertulla.</span></p>

<p>Strange! A circumstance beyond my power to explain,
but.... [<i>She speaks confidentially so that <span class="smcap">Pertinax</span>

when I say he resembles Pertinax!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Pertinax.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Having crept close to listen.</i>] O felicitous omen!
Accept it, Asteria Tertia, and that you shall not repent
yourself of it will I dedicate my life!</p>

Well, Valentinus! Has Tulla convinced you
of her loathing for that insect Pertinax? If so we will
amuse ourselves while feasting in devising means to torture
him, after which we will all be baptised! I understand

<h4>FOREWORD</h4>

<p>Let us take a flight backward over fifteen centuries to
a date somewhere about A. D. 410. The Roman Empire
is the centre of the civilised world, with Constantinople
for its capital and Theodosius II upon the throne. Let
us imagine ourselves in Asia Minor, visiting a city of
Lydia which we are accustomed to call in Roman fashion
Ephesus, but which we will to-day spell Ephesos to remind
us of a fact of which it was too proud ever to forget ...
its Greek origin. Indeed Ephesos at all times seems to
have held its head high. It prided itself for one thing
on its commercial importance, its situation rendering it
an admirable starting-place for Roman legions on their
eastward march of conquest no less than an admirable port
from which the spoils of the orient, brought across the
desert routes by caravan, could be shipped to western
markets. From this it gained the name of Key, or Gateway,
to the eastern Empire. In the earlier days of its
history Ephesos had also proudly styled itself the Temple-Keeper
City on account of its devotion to the great nature-goddess
Artemis in whose honour a magnificent sanctuary
had been erected there some thousand years before this day
we are to relive in the reign of Theodosius II. Little gold
and silver shrines of Artemis were fabricated and sold in
Ephesos while Christianity was still under a ban, and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
as you will recall, it was the fear of the guild of smith-craftsmen
that the new religion would deprive them of this
industry that caused an uprising against the Apostle Paul
during his missionary labours there. Then when Constantine
the Great declared in favour of Christianity,
causing it to be the officially established religion of Imperial
Rome, we find Ephesos priding itself on the zeal
with which it renounces its ancient deities, and either
razing the temples of these or converting them into
churches with forms of worship adapted to the new creed.</p>

<p>It is a holiday in spring, and holidays here seem much
the same as elsewhere. Schoolboys freed from the rule
of didaskalos go to the shores of the River Kaÿstros to skip
oyster shells, or they play hide-and-seek in the fields of
wheat and millet that grow high as a man’s head. Perhaps
when the back of the Centurion with his vine-branch
rod is turned they will form a group in the pleasant shade
of some portico to match coins. “Heads or ships?” we
shall hear them say, if by chance a Roman piece has found
its way among the locally minted currency. Picnic parties
attended by slaves bearing huge baskets of provisions
will be seeking the quarried sides of Prion and Kóressos,
the beautiful mountains that overlook Ephesos. Stories
will be told by the old to the young: legends of the days
when the Temple of Artemis ... now but a picturesque
ruin ... was sanctuary during a Persian invasion; later
fables of the persecutions instituted by the Emperor Decius
against the professors of the new religion who were fain
to meet by stealth in upper chambers to worship, or be
scourged, thrown, perchance, to beasts in the arena. Perhaps
some antiquarian will have discovered a papyrus on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
which he has deciphered a hymn in praise of Artemis,
coupled with an ode to the City, to be sung by the Epheboi,
the youths of the place, and the girls destined to be
Temple priestesses, at the great festival of springtide when
nature’s self celebrates the glory of resurrection after its
winter sleep, and decks the world with flowers. In those
days the month of festival was called Artemision, but
now it is known as Easter! Listen to the chants from the
churches dedicated to St. Paul, St. John! But even as
you hear the “Glory to the Father” the winds that acknowledge
no religion, old or new, and the echoes that witness
them all, bring back to life the strains of the ancient
processional, sung to flute, harp and lyre, in praise of
the banished goddess Artemis by boys and girls over whose
graves the flowers of nigh two centuries have grown!</p>

<p>The winds fold their wings among the hills and the
echoes slip back into the valleys with their memories of
boys and girls with their flowering garlands, incense bearers,
priests and priestesses of long ago who used to march
through the city and climb the hill to the Temple in the
month of Artemision; and the cross over the gateway
that we see in the distance, and the peal of the Gloria
from the churches remind us that this is a modern and
Christian Ephesos through which we are wandering at
Eastertide in the year 410. From the market-place we
have passed to the stadion where the young athletes of
the place are practising for the games that will be held
later on, and now our steps have brought us beyond city
bounds in the direction of Kóressos. Here we find that,
although it is a holiday, gangs of slaves directed by an
overseer are busily quarrying the grey marble for which
this mountain is famed. Mingling with the bystanders
we pause to watch them as they tear down a pile of loose,
large stones that seem at some time to have been stacked
up against what looks like a solid wall of masonry. As
the sun is high and we are wearied with our climb we
join a group sitting in the shadow of a plane tree, enjoying
the view, listening to the distant chimes and the anthems<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
of praise from the churches. Meanwhile our attention
is arrested by the talk that goes on about us.</p>

<span class="smcap">Princess Moss-Rose</span>. These take place in the hall
of her father’s castle. Besides the <span class="smcap">Princess</span> herself

<span class="smcap">Huntsmen</span>, <span class="smcap">Pages</span> and <span class="smcap">Lackeys</span>, too, will come and
go as they are needed. Then there is a <span class="smcap">Frog</span> of high
degree in Frogdom, who will receive the knightly accolade,
thereafter being known as <span class="smcap">Sir Amphibious
Batrachian</span>, with the right also to call himself
<span class="smcap">Baron Freshwater</span>. <span class="smcap">Two Tadpoles</span> who grow up
into rather grouchy, rheumatic elderly <span class="smcap">Frogs</span> are of
his retinue. The <span class="smcap">Three Fates</span> and <span class="smcap">Destiny</span> have
inconspicuous, but important parts in the <span class="smcap">Events</span>.
Then we shall also see several <span class="smcap">Fragments</span> of <span class="smcap">Kings’
Sons</span> who have perished in their quest for the fabled
<span class="smcap">Moss-Rose</span>, and, accompanied by his tutor, <span class="smcap">Mentor</span>,
the victorous King’s Son, <span class="smcap">Prince Charming</span>. Sixteen
years divide the <span class="smcap">Second Event</span> from the first,
and one hundred years the <span class="smcap">Third</span> from the <span class="smcap">Second</span>.
These passages of time, however, touch our royal
friends but lightly, and do not cause their royal
clothes to wear out, or their royal furniture to become
shabby in the least. The scene is laid in the hall of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
the <span class="smcap">King’s</span> castle, an apartment of suitable magnificence.
Entrances lead to banqueting-hall, servants’

and are champing and pawing the ground, the

the castle? Or is Her Majesty desirous of purchasing
a new crown? If so, can’t you suggest to her to get
the old one turned and made over? The jewels in it are
not in the least shabby; they are as good as new, in fact!</p>

<p>This morning I went into the garden to watch the
gardener set out the rose bed, and while sitting there beside
the fountain a great big frog jumped out of the basin,
and spoke to me. It is true that he splashed me a wee
bit, but he apologised so prettily I didn’t really mind!
“Good morning, fair Queen,” said he. “I know wherefore
you are sad!”</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The King.</span></p>

<p>Oh! But were you sad?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Queen.</span></p>

<p>No! But that’s what he said! “Cease weeping and dry
your lovely eyes,” he then went on!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The King.</span></p>

<p>But were you weeping, and did you dry your lovely eyes?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Queen.</span></p>

<p>No, I can’t say I was or did! However that’s what he
said!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Chancellor.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Explains.</i>] Queens and princesses generally weep beside
a fountain, Sire! You’ll find it here in the “Book of
Royal Etiquette”! [<i>He turns over the leaves of a huge
volume.</i>] It is customary for them accidentally to drop
a precious ring into its green depths, and then to shed
tears over it!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The King.</span></p>

<p>I see! Go on, my love!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Queen.</span></p>

<p>The frog continued, “It is your birthday!” “Oh,” I
replied, “I know that! And I’m sure the dear King is
going to surprise me with a beautiful present!”</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The King.</span></p>

<p>Of course! I was just on my way to inquire why it
has not been sent!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Queen.</span></p>

<p>But it has been sent! It is here! That is the great
news! That is what the frog told me! “Go home,” said
he, “and look in your work-basket, and see what you will
find all rolled up in the red and yellow comforter you are
knitting for a surprise for the King on his birthday!”
And there indeed I found it! And, oh, nothing else in
all the world could have given me one millionth part of
the pleasure!</p>

<p>Dear, dear, there you go again! I’ve been all over the
map, and there’s nobody, positively nobody, that will do!
They are all so ignorant; they only speak foreign languages!
What do I want with a son-in-law who can only
laugh at my jokes through an interpreter?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Chancellor.</span></p>

<p>None the less, Sire, we cannot have our Princess remain
a sp... er ... unmarried!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Moss-Rose.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With quick curiosity.</i>] What is the word you were
going to say, beginning with s-p?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Chancellor.</span></p>

<p>Ahem! Pardon, my dear; I was not going to say anything
of the sort! There is no word applicable to the
situation beginning with s-p!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Moss-Rose.</span></p>

and all that, you know!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Moss-Rose.</span></p>

<p>It is the same way with music; some kinds of songs are
blotted out for Princesses, it seems! There was the prettiest
song I came upon. It sounded buzz, buzz, buzz, like
the turning of a wheel! But my teacher said that I must
never, never sing it! Now why not, I wonder!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The King.</span></p>

<p>My Lords and Ladies.... This, as you know, is the
sixteenth anniversary of the birth of our beloved daughter,
the Princess Moss-Rose. For the benefit of such of
you as were not here when Heaven sent her to us we will
rehearse an incident that then took place. To her christening
feast as godmothers were bidden all the Good
Fairies and Wise Women in our kingdom—</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Frog.</span></p>

<p>—to co-operate with me as godfather! I held the child
at the font!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The King.</span></p>

<p>There were twelve of these ladies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Chancellor.</span></p>

<p>Thirteen, Sire!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The King.</span></p>

<p>True, but thirteen is an unlucky number! That is why
I suppressed one!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Queen.</span></p>

<p>And the thirteenth wasn’t a nice person at all! Not at
all! Besides we had only a dozen extra spoons and forks!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The King.</span></p>

<p>But all the same, this Dame Envy-Hatred-Malice-and-All-Uncharitableness
got wind of the affair and came uninvited!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Chancellor.</span></p>

<p>Oh, if you had only let me manage it!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The King.</span></p>

<p>Well—she came!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Queen.</span></p>

<p>She wasn’t at all nice! And I didn’t like the way she
was dressed one bit! Not one bit!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The King.</span></p>

<p>Our valued Sir Amphibious presented the mug—[<i>Indicates
the mug.</i>] Sterling silver and richly chased!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Frog.</span></p>

<p>Aye, indeed! I chased it round and round the pond
when it was first dropped in, for at least three centuries!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The King.</span></p>

<p>The twelve godmothers bestowed good wishes on our
child—</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Chancellor.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Referring to a volume.</i>] Entered over their own signatures
in the guest-book. The kindest wishes, though
expressed in verse of an impromptu and inferior cast!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The King.</span></p>

<p>But the uninvited and unwelcome one revenged herself
by putting on our child a curse! [<i><span class="smcap">All</span> echo, “A curse!”</i>]
Read it, my Lord Chancellor!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Chancellor.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Referring to volume.</i>] That on the sixteenth anniversary
of her birth the Princess Moss-Rose should prick
her finger with the spindle of a spinning-wheel, and die
of the wound. [<i><span class="smcap">All</span>, even those who are familiar with the
story, exclaim with horror.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The King.</span></p>

<p>No wonder you shudder! No wonder tongue and pen
alike recoil from chronicling the incident! However, our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
dear Sir Amphibious exercised his prerogative, in also
making for our child a wish.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Queen.</span></p>

<p>So sweet of him when he had already given the mug!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Frog.</span></p>

<p>Oh, don’t mention it! What godfather under like circumstances
would not do the same? I could not unwish
the old hag’s wish, but at least it was within my humble
powers to modify it!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Chancellor.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Referring to the volume.</i>] Sir Amphibious fortunately
was able to cross out the unpleasant word <i>die</i> and substitute
for it, <i>sleep for a term not exceeding one hundred
years</i>!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Frog.</span></p>

<p>That’s it! A mere bagatelle, one hundred years, when
measured up with eternity, eh, what!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The King.</span></p>

<p>But, even so, do we want the light of our eyes and sunshine
of our lives suspended for a century!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">All.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With emphasis.</i>] No!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Queen.</span></p>

<p>Even suppose that the King and I were to survive it, it
would be most awkward to introduce to society a débutante
Princess of a hundred and sixteen years of age!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Chancellor.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Shaking his head mournfully.</i>] The only suitable alliance
would be found in a Home for Aged Princes! It
is true that some of the abdicated ones are in an excellent
state of preservation, but it isn’t the same thing!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">All.</span></p>

<p>Not at all the same thing!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The King.</span></p>

<p>To prevent these little contre-tempses, as the French
call them, I forthwith issued a proclamation—</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Chancellor.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Referring to volume.</i>] All spinning-wheels to be banished
from the kingdom—</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Queen.</span></p>

<p>It has made the price of household linen dreadfully
high, but what else could we do?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Chancellor.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Continuing, from volume.</i>] The word <i>spin</i> with all its
variants to be blotted from dictionaries, dropped from conversation.
To compose or sing a spinning-wheel song a
capital offence. All spinsters to choose between death or
matrimony!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Queen.</span></p>

<p>And all of the self-sacrificing dears chose matrimony!
So loyal of them!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The King.</span></p>

<p>Now while we flatter ourselves that our Anti-spindle
campaign has been an unqualified success, yet there is this
day with its fatal possibilities to be safely passed through!
The question before us is, how best to guard the Princess
from the one chance in a million-billion that a spindle yet
exists!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Frog.</span></p>

<p>Let her spend it with me at the bottom of the pond!
[<i><span class="smcap">All</span> murmur appreciatively.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Queen.</span></p>

<p>How dear of you! But she isn’t used to the damp!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The King.</span></p>

<p>Besides, someone might have thrown a spinning-wheel,
or just the spindle, into it, you know!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">All.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Considering.</i>] That’s true!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Chancellor.</span></p>

<p>So long as there’s no precedent to go by, suppose we
ourselves adopt an original measure. Suppose we take the
Princess into our confidence so that she can herself be on
her guard! [<i>This gives rise to murmurs, some approving,
others dissenting.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The King.</span></p>

<p>It’s rather radical, not to say subversive, to teach young
people anything that isn’t perfectly pleasant, but—isn’t
it best to let them find out for themselves that roses have
thorns?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Chancellor.</span></p>

<p>Hardly, Sire, considering the price of the prick!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Frog.</span></p>

<p>That’s what I have always said!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Queen.</span></p>

<p>Yes, but then you two haven’t the feelings of a mother!
If you think there are no pricks, why, then there are none!...
Ouch! What was that?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The King.</span></p>

<p>Oh, nothing, my love! I only stuck a pin into your
arm to test your theory!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Queen.</span></p>

<p>But it isn’t a fair test unless you tell that you are going
to do it, so that I can make up my mind not to feel it!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The King.</span></p>

<p>I see! Well, but to come back to the question, who is
to tell our child of the peril in which she stands?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Queen.</span></p>

<p>Why, you, of course! You are head of the family!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The King.</span></p>

<p>Only when there’s something unpleasant to be done!
When it’s a matter of buying new head-gear, Paris hats,
and all that, who is head of the family then, I’d like to
know!—However, I suppose I had better take the child
into the library, and say: “My child, I do not wish to
alarm you, but—” [<i><span class="smcap">All</span> murmur, protesting against
this.</i>] Oh, very well, then! Someone else will have to
do it!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Chancellor.</span></p>

<p>Couldn’t it be led up to diplomatically, Sire? Use
tact! As thus: “How pretty you look to-day, my little
daughter! Which reminds me; speaking of the uncertainty
of life—” [<i>Again <span class="smcap">All</span> protest.</i>] Oh, as you
please! I only threw out the suggestion!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Frog.</span></p>

<p>Why not be playful? Introduce death jocosely into
the conversation! Begin with dead letters and go on to
the dead languages! Ask her how long a dead-weight is!
And if a dead-lock grows on a dead-head! [<i>Again <span class="smcap">All</span>
protest strongly.</i>] Oh, very well! Do it your own way!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The King.</span></p>

<p>Why can’t the child’s governess teach her all about it?
It seems to me it is a matter of education, entirely!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Governess.</span></p>

<p>Pardon, Sire. Questions concerning life and death were
strictly barred from the curriculum on which my diploma
was obtained!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The King.</span></p>

<p>Well, something has to be done; that’s clear!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">All.</span></p>

<p>Yes, that’s clear!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The King.</span></p>

<p>But what? And how? That’s the question!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">All.</span></p>

<p>Yes, that’s the question!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Queen.</span></p>

<p>I have an idea! Let us all tell her, together, in concert!
[<i><span class="smcap">All</span> assent.</i>] Let us all begin, “My dear little
Moss-Rose—Our dear little Moss-Rose—”</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">All.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Clap hands.</i>] Oh, excellent!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The King.</span></p>

<p>Yes! Well, and then—?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Queen.</span></p>

<p>Yes; what then?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">All.</span></p>

<p>Yes; what then?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Nurse.</span></p>

<p>Madam, if I may make so bold—</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Queen.</span></p>

<p>Well, nurse? What have you to suggest?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Nurse.</span></p>

<p>The Princess has always been keen about fairy-stories!
Why not tell it to her, each contributing a bit, as if it
were a fairy-story? Begin, Once upon a time!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i><span class="smcap">All</span> exclaim, interested.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Queen.</span></p>

<p>But, my dear soul; this is true! How can we pretend
about it?</p>

<p class="direction">[<i><span class="smcap">All</span> agree to this view of the matter.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Nurse.</span></p>

<p>Madam, it’s by pretending that truth is a fairy-story we
make children know it’s true!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Queen.</span></p>

<p>Nurse, you’re a darling, but so old-fashioned! Fairy-stories
don’t happen nowadays, do they, Sir Amphibious?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Frog.</span></p>

<p>My old grandmother, Mother Goose, believes in them!
But then, she’s a Mother Goose!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Gardener.</span></p>

<p>Fairy-stories happen in the greenhouse, and miracles in
the garden all the time! I help ’em along! Why, look
at that bonny moss-rose bush! Sixteen years from to-day
it was but a wee slip, as tiny in its way as the Princess in
hers!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The King.</span></p>

<p>But, my dear fellow, that’s only nature, and we are
talking about life and death, which are social functions,
eh, my Lord High Chancellor?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>

the leaves of the presentation-copy-refutation remain uncut!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Prince.</span></p>

<p>But, my dear Mentor, how do you account for the disappearance
of King Johannes Johann Ivor Ivan Ian
Giovanni Juan Jean John? The sudden mysterious
disappearance with all his court that caused my royal ancestors
to annex the kingdom to their own! It’s an historical
fact, you know!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mentor.</span></p>

<p>Oh, probably good King Jack got into some slight
trouble—violated the game laws, or something, so abdicated
and went quietly abroad, leaving the Court Chronicler
to invent some pretty tale to hush up the scandal!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Prince.</span></p>

<p>But this forest that we have hewed and hacked our way
through—How do you account for it that every living
thing in it, bird and beast, is fast, fast asleep?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mentor.</span></p>

<p>The sleeping sickness is nothing new! Everyone, from
Adam down, who has had to sit through after-dinner oratory
has felt a touch of it! It is only the orators who
are immune!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Prince.</span></p>

<p>And this forest—this marvellous forest of moss-roses?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mentor.</span></p>

<p>Just moss-roses! The soil in this region happens to be
peculiarly favourable to their growth!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Prince.</span></p>

<p>And the Princess herself, the heart and soul and living
embodiment of a moss-rose?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mentor.</span></p>

<p>My dear lad, all youths of the princely temperament
are like you! All want to turn the cold hard facts of science
into romance, with a beautiful maid at the root of
a beautiful mystery! To let you into a family confidence,
it originated with my great-aunt! Oh, she was not beautiful;
she was practical and punctual, like me! In order
to be always in the right and put her husband always in
the wrong she used to turn the hands of the clock to whatever
hour she thought would be for his best good! It
was one of those large, old-fashioned clocks, you know!
And one night, while inside the case, she got caught in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
the works, and for eight days went up and down, clinging
to the weights, ticking off the seconds, striking the hours,
before she was rescued by the little Swiss man who came
periodically to wind and regulate the household time-pieces!
My great-uncle-by-marriage, though at the time
distracted with anxiety, has since been heard to say that
those were the happiest because the most unpunctual hours
of his life! Since which time it has passed into a proverb
when anything is wrong with the works of anything to
look for a woman in the case!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Prince.</span></p>

<p>What you say no doubt is true, and yet—</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mentor.</span></p>

<p>And yet, like all young fools you won’t believe me till
you yourself have proved it! In spite of all these warnings,
in the shape of fragments of Kings’ Sons who have
lost their lives in the attempt! If these poor witnesses
could speak, which, think you, would say, go forward,
Prince Charming? Persevere unto the end!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Prince.</span></p>

<p>Which, think, you, would say, Turn back, Prince Charming!
Give it up!</p>

<p>Sir, we ask the privilege of following the adventure with
you! In our tadpole days, aye, even as pollywogs, we
were devoted to the Frog who was the oldest and most respected
inhabitant of our pond. When he was chosen godfather
to the Princess it was we who carried the christening
mug to the palace. We were present when he was
knighted, and baroneted! And now, if he has dried up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
we wish to bestow on him a watery grave and dig a mud-hole
to his memory. [<i>He weeps.</i>]</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE TESTING OF SIR GAWAYNE</h3>

</div>

<p class="center"><i>All Hallowe’en</i></p>

<p class="hanging"><i>What follows takes place at King Arthur’s Court in merry
Carlisle, on the Eve of All-Hallowmass when strange
things happen ... when the wicked crafts of sorcery
work havoc with knightly adventure, and when enchantments
bring about marvelous endings in affairs
of love. We find ourselves looking backward through
the years upon a scene that renews itself before our
eyes in the castle hall. On one side is the banqueting-hall,
and this way the servants pass to the
kitchen [kitching we shall hear it called by Sir Kay,
the steward or Seneschal.] On the other side the
members of the Court pass to their sleeping-chambers
or to the massive door that opens to the outer world.
A window gives, first, the light of late afternoon in
autumn, then moonlight, and finally a bright dawn.
A fire on the great hearth affords a cheerful glow.
When it is necessary to light the hall servants will set
torches in their sockets against the wall. The walls
are adorned with trophies of the chase, and with the
arms of knight-errantry. A table, settees, a few
plain chairs, and throne-chairs for the King and Queen
suffice for furnishing. We shall now and then be
taxed in our memory of French and Latin to understand
some of the expressions we shall hear ... as,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
for instance, when someone bidding others leave the
room cries, “Avoid! Avoid!” or when the word
“quest” is used at one time as we should say “question,”
and at another for “adventure.” We shall observe,
too, that forms we have been taught to consider
common or ungrammatical, obtained then in
polite language, such as “afore” where we now say
“before,” or the double negative, “not never.” This
is something that should make us hesitate before we
criticise the speech of simple people, country-folk, and
ask ourselves if their homely phrase is not after all
but a survival of the elegance of days gone by. It
will interest us furthermore to note how in these days
of chivalry when religion, love, and deeds of arms
are the topics of the chronicler how freely, though not
lightly, the names of Holy Persons are invoked in conversation.
The <span class="smcap">Characters</span> whom we shall see
enact the little drama are <span class="smcap">King Arthur</span> and his
lovely <span class="smcap">Queen Guinevere</span>, several <span class="smcap">Knights of the
Round Table</span>, including <span class="smcap">Sir Kay</span>, the gruff steward
or Seneschal, <span class="smcap">Sir Bors</span>, <span class="smcap">Sir Bleoberis</span>, <span class="smcap">Sir Meliogrance</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Sir Gawayne</span> about whom the story
concerns itself. Then there is the <span class="smcap">Knight</span> the rescue
of whom nearly cost <span class="smcap">Arthur</span> his realm, his life,
and his queen. Also there is the <span class="smcap">Little Page</span> who
for his precocious valour was dubbed knight and thereafter
known as <span class="smcap">Sir Griflet</span>, and there is the <span class="smcap">Outrageous
Giant</span> who was but the gallant <span class="smcap">Knight
Déliveré</span> under a spell of enchantment. Among the
ladies we find <span class="smcap">Dame Laurel</span>, and the <span class="smcap">Damosel</span> who
rode in such breathless haste to <span class="smcap">Arthur’s</span> court, seeking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
aid for her captive <span class="smcap">Knight</span>. And, most important
is the <span class="smcap">Déliverance La Belle Pilgrim</span> who
was mocked at for being “a loathly lady.” And of
course there are <span class="smcap">Pages</span> and <span class="smcap">Servants</span> and <span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>
and <span class="smcap">Women</span> in waiting and <span class="smcap">Squires</span> and all the
royal rest.</i></p>

<p class="hanging"><i>The <span class="smcap">Queen</span> is seated at her embroidery-frame, some of
her <span class="smcap">Ladies</span> similarly occupied about her. The <span class="smcap">Damosel</span>
sits near trying to fix her thoughts upon a
scroll that she however does not read. Some of the
<span class="smcap">Knights</span> are occupying themselves peacefully in divers
ways, two playing a game of chess. Someone
sings to the harp. Meanwhile the <span class="smcap">Little Page</span> keeps
watch at the window.</i></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Guinevere.</span></p>

<p>Are there no signs yet of my lord that he doth return?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Page.</span></p>

<p>Not yet, madam!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Guinevere.</span></p>

<p>Alas! Evensong time is overpassed, and my lord comes
not!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Damosel.</span></p>

<p>Now is my heart more heavier than ever it was before
for the sorrow I have brought upon the gentlest and fairest
lady of the world!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Guinevere.</span></p>

<p>Ah, you do well to let fall down your head for shame,
for we had never been in this sorry pass if you had never
come hitherward, praying King Arthur for succour for
your knight!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Damosel.</span></p>

<p>Ah, Madam, I pray you of mercy to mis-say me no more,
for my heart is like to brast with its own woe!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Sir Kay.</span></p>

<p>Madam, you are greatly to blame so to rebuke the
damosel, for, wit ye well, of his own will my Lord King
Arthur did seek and take him upon that hard adventure
he is gone upon!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Guinevere.</span></p>

<p>So God me help, it is all the greater shame to all you
noble knights that your fellowship should suffer your king
to take such an adventure upon him to his destruction!
[<i><span class="smcap">The Knights</span> exclaim, crying, “Gramercy, Madam!
Now by my head, etc.” But much wrought up, the <span class="smcap">Queen</span>
continues.</i>] Ah, now, I see well that all coward knights
be not dead, sith you, Sir Bors, and you, Sir Bleoberis, sit
playing at the chess, the while my dear Lord, your King,
may be mishandled and smitten down, horse and man, or
villainously wounded, or, peradventure, slain!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i><span class="smcap">The Two Knights</span> thus addressed start up, angrily.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Sir Bleoberis.</span></p>

<p>Gramercy, Madam! It passeth bounds that you should
put the suspection of cowardice on me, and there is no
knight under heaven that dare make it good on me!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Sir Bors.</span></p>

<p>Madam, you are a woman, and may not fight, but let
now some worshipful knight of our fellowship take on
himself your quarrel, and call me coward, and here is my
glove to prove the contrary with my hands upon his body!
[<i>Throws down his glove.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Sir Meliogrance.</span></p>

<p>Then here am I known to all men as Sir Meliogrance,
and I will take on me my lady the Queen’s quarrel, and
I will joust with you, Sir Bleoberis, and you, Sir Bors,
proving you recreant knights with my hands upon your
bodies! [<i>He throws down his glove.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Damosel.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Moans.</i>] Now am I right heavy for the sorrow I have
brought upon King Arthur’s Court!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">A Little Page.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Runs forward, challengingly.</i>] Now though hardly of
years to bear a shield, yet if some worshipful knight of
this fellowship will dub me his knight, then will I too
take on me the Queen’s quarrel, jousting with the knights<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
of these worshipful knights’ following, for leaver would
I be cut into an hundred pieces than that my dear Lady
should be gainsayed! [<i>The closing words, spoken almost
with sobs.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Some of the Ladies.</span></p>

<p>Oh, spoken like a sweet and noble child!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Many of the <span class="smcap">Knights</span> laugh.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Sir Bors.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Affecting to shudder.</i>] Boo-oo! My gentlemen had

come among us!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i><span class="smcap">A Fellow-Page</span> giggles tauntingly at our hero who

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Little Page.</span></p>

<p>I am of gentle blood, and but for lack of beard, as well
entitled to bear arms as any of this worshipful fellowship,
and if anyone is so venturesome that he would say the
contrary I will make it good with my body upon his body,
with these two hands tearing him limb from limb! [<i>The
<span class="smcap">Giggling Page</span> retreats, affrighted.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Sir Bleoberis.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With impatience.</i>] Is this a pages’ affair or a quarrel
among knights of worship and renown?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Guinevere.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With emotion.</i>] Peace, my good Griflet! And you,
gentlemen, forbear! I spake over hastily!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Sir Kay.</span></p>

<p>Peace, daffish knights! Pick up your gloves! See ye
not that the Queen is distraught and clean out of her
wits with anxiousness for the safety of the King?...
Madam, you do ill to begrudge King Arthur his lone questings,
sith all men of high courage find it merry to serve
under a chieftain that will put his person in adventure
as other poor knights do! [<i>To this there is a general
murmur of assent.</i>] And now, as the tables have been
spread this long while, for the third time of asking, will
it pleasure you to sit down to supper?</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Another general murmur shows that this suggestion
meets with favour.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Guinevere.</span></p>

<p>Let those eat and drink who can! My heart is too
heavy, but go you all, my lords and ladies, gentlemen and
gentlewomen! Sit you down to meat and enjoy the feast!
Later will I sup privily with my lord on his return!...
As for you, worshipful knights, let me who provoked the
quarrel between you heal it without the letting of good
blood!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Before the would-be combatants can prevent her she

<p>Not so! I had your queen in forfeit!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Sir Bleoberis.</span></p>

will make or mar the fortunes of the King!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>From the banqueting-hall one hears the sounds of
merry-making subdued, and the strains of minstrelsy,

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Guinevere.</span></p>

<p>Now let saddle horses, and guided by you, good damosel,
I will follow after my lord!... Hark! I hear an
horn!... Arthur!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>The winding notes of the horn are heard.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Little Page.</span></p>

<p>[<i>At the window.</i>] Nay, Madam! It is but Sir Gawayne
who returns from hunting!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Guinevere.</span></p>

<p>Sir Gawayne! Let send for him! [<i><span class="smcap">The Page</span> hastens
out.</i>] It may be he brings tidings of my Lord!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i><span class="smcap">The Page</span> returns, attending on <span class="smcap">Sir Gawayne</span>.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Sir Gawayne.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Kneeling to kiss the hand of the <span class="smcap">Queen</span>.</i>] Fair Queen
and dear Aunt Guinevere! But wherefore do I find you
in such heavy cheer with the tears upon your cheeks?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Guinevere.</span></p>

<p>Ah, Gawayne! Your dear Uncle, my good Lord, the
King.... But sit we down and ye shall hear! [<i>They
sit.</i>] It was yestreen at the undern hour that we sat here,
listening to minstrelsy! All of a sudden the King cried
out, “Now by the Holy Rood the third day hence will be
All-Hallowmass! Now by the faith of my body and on
my head as anointed king will I not set me down to meat
on All-Hallowmass until I shall have taken on me and
brought to a good end some high quest that shall bring
to me and my goodly fellowship great worship and renown!”
Hardly had he so spoken when riding into the
hall came this damosel who thereon alighted from her
palfrey and threw herself flatling at my good lord’s feet
and lay there grovelling and praying him for succour for
her knight!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Damosel.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Weeping.</i>] Alas that ever I came!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Guinevere.</span></p>

<p>Fie upon you for weeping when tears are all no boot!
Relate your errand to Sir Gawayne!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">The Damosel.</span></p>

<p>It fortuned in this wise: my troth was plighted that I
should be wedded to a passing fair gentleman and knight
of haut renown, a true lover and deserving of a good end!
As together we rode forth, planning for our marriage, we
passed through a dark forest till we happed upon a grimly
castle! As we gazed upon its towers wondering who might
dwell therein out rushed a churlish knight, Oh, a mighty
giant, one of the world’s perilous fighters, seven times the
height of mortal man, and with the strength of seven men!
[<i>In spite of his bravado the <span class="smcap">Little Page</span> shivers audibly.</i>]
Nathless all undaunted my knight dressed his shield and
set his spear, crying, “How now, rude Saracen! An ye
be a true fighter come and prove it, spear to spear, and
sword to sword, and body to body!” But the miscreant
laughed in mockage, and set on my poor love, belabouring
him with a huge club, and dragged him down from his
saddle, shivering his spear, and shattering his sword, and
splitting his helm clear through to the brain-pan! [<i>At
this the <span class="smcap">Little Page</span> shudders in delighted horror.</i>]
Ah, little page, I see well now that ye like this tale, but I
do assure you it is no matter for enjoyment!... And
all this while I shrieked shrilly and kneeled in the mire
before the churlish wight, with my two hands lifted, praying
him for the love of Heaven to have mercy on my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
knight! But the murtherous monster only laughed the
louder, with a great noise like thunder, spitting flames
from his enormous mouth, and bound my knight hand
and feet and threw him into the dungeon keep, the while
I, leaping on my palfrey, made my escape, riding hither,
like the wind, to merry Carlisle, to King Arthur’s court,
clear into this very hall, and threw myself at the King’s
feet, praying succour for my love! [<i>Weeps.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Guinevere.</span></p>

<p>And did my Lord stay his hand? “Gramercy,” cried
he, “but this is the quest that even now I prayed for!
Nor by the faith of my body as anointed king will I set
me down to meat on All-Hallowmass or ever I shall have
brought it to a good end!” And then he made no more
words, but took his shield and buckled it about his neck,
and girt on his good sword Excalibur, and lightly he took
his horse and leaped upon him, and departed on his way!
And, though it is but a little faring hence, last night went
by, and to-day the hour of evensong is overpassed, and he
comes not back! [<i>Weeps.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Sir Gawayne.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Walks, perturbed.</i>] Now meseemeth for to tempt God
it is no wisdom, and the King hath put this realm into
the greatest domage that ever realm was in by jeoparding
his life in hazard with a giant!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Guinevere.</span></p>

<p>Ye say truth!—Gawayne—[<i>She advances toward the
knight, and speaks impressively.</i>] All other knights of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
the good fellowship say that it would put rebukes on Arthur,
shaming him through England, Ireland, Wales and
Scotland, for to seek to rescue him in an adventure he
has made oath to enterprise alone! But I say, not so,
sithen it is no mortal man he has to do with, but a churlish
wight, an outrageous giant, armed with the craft of
sorcery!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Sir Gawayne.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Struck by this argument.</i>] By my head that sounds
like a good counsel!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Guinevere.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Following up her advantage.</i>] Then by your knighthood
and fealty do I charge ye, take upon yourself this
matter!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Sir Gawayne.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With due solemnity.</i>] That will I do, and that will I
swear to do, by my blood; as a Knight of the Round Table,
and on the Four Evangelists! [<i>He kisses the hand of
the <span class="smcap">Queen</span> and is about to go, but pauses, as the winding
notes of a horn are heard. All exclaim.</i>]</p>

pray you that you will expound your fearsome rede!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>That will I do!... Let all be seated. [<i><span class="smcap">All</span> obey the
<span class="smcap">King</span>, whereupon <span class="smcap">Arthur</span> explains.</i>] How I took oath
on my head as anointed king not to set me down to meat
on All-Hallowmass or I had undertaken some haut quest
already do ye know. [<i><span class="smcap">All</span> assent.</i>] Also know ye how
this damosel came riding hither into this hall, seeking
succour for her knight! [<i>Again <span class="smcap">All</span> assent.</i>] And none
is there that knows not how forthwith I enterprised the
matter! [<i>Again <span class="smcap">All</span> assent.</i>] Now hear ye how I fared
with it! [<i><span class="smcap">All</span> settle themselves like children to whom a
thrilling tale is to be told.</i>] Arrived afore the grimly
tower I blew my horn and cried, “How now, Sir Knight,
an ye be a fair fighter come, prove it, spear to spear and
sword to sword, and body to body!” Whereon rushed
forth the most outrageous churl and greatest murtherer
was ever seen, with a huge laughter like thunder, and
spitting flames of fire from his monstrous mouth! And
by sorcery he cast an evil spell on me, so that its scabbard
would not loose my sword Excalibur, and my arm fell
helpless to my side like as it had been the arm of a dead<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
corp! [<i>The <span class="smcap">Ladies</span> and the younger <span class="smcap">Pages</span> shudder audibly.</i>]
“How, now, King Arthur,” cried the rude churl,
“I have you at a vantage, so best yield yourself without
ado!” “Now not ever, nor never on my head,” I answered
him, “for I had leaver to be hacked to bits than
cry mercy of such a fiendly knight that it is no true knight
at all!” [<i>General exclamations of approval greet this,
many crying, “Oh well said!” ... “Spoken in kingly-wise!”
etc.</i>] “Then,” said he, “you leese, not alone your
life the which you seem to hold so light, but also your
realms, and your queen!” [<i>Again there is a shuddering
sensation.</i>] Well, for to curtail a long tale short, “Come,”
said he, “I will release the knight the which to deliver
you came, and suffer you to depart as you came upon certain
conditions!” “Name them,” said I. “That you
shall promise by the Holy Rood that you will not set you
down to meat on All-Hallowmass until you shall have
brought me the answer to a rede that I shall now propound
to you!” “I assent to these,” I said!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i><span class="smcap">All</span> breathe a long sigh of relief, with exclamations
of thankfulness that all has turned out so well.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Guinevere.</span></p>

<p>Now, scarce can I wait to go to the Minster to do my
thankings to God for such deliverance!... But the rede,
my Lord! The rede!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">All.</span></p>

<p>Aye, Sir, the rede!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Well may you ask! “What is it that all women most
desire?”</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">All.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Repeat, as it were a lesson.</i>] “What is it that all
women most desire?”</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Guinevere.</span></p>

<p>“What is it that all women most desire?” Oh, my dear
love, as if there could be but one answer to that! All
women most desire what I, most fortunate of women,
have: A loving husband which is also a true and faithful
knight of worship and renown!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Many of those present concur in this, saying, “In
sooth the Queen speaks for all!” and, “Now, could
there be two minds about that!” and, “Gramercy,
so also say I!” Others, however, differ, murmuring,
“I doubt that is right!” and, “What is truth
for one may not be truth for other!” and the like.
<span class="smcap">Guinevere</span> notices this and exclaims, saying</i>] How
now! It seems we are not all of one opinion!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dame Laurel.</span></p>

<p>Madam, is it permitted that we may speak freely, each

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Guinevere.</span></p>

do so, for so only shall we arrive at true conclusions!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dame Laurel.</span></p>

<p>Then, above the desire of a woman for a loving husband
and worshipful knight do I set the desire of all women
to be beautiful! [<i>There is a murmur of assent from
many. The <span class="smcap">Dame</span> continues.</i>] For in the end beauty
wins the husband, and so, possessing one, shall the woman
be ensured of both! [<i>This provokes a general laugh.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Guinevere.</span></p>

<p>Many minds, many counsels, it would seem! Let now
a clerkly scribe set down in writing these divers answers to
our quest, to the end that my Lord may take his choice of
them! [<i><span class="smcap">A Scribe</span> prepares to write. Meanwhile, at a

what, say you, do all women most desire?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Sir Bors.</span></p>

<p>Madam, I know not what all women do most desire, but
I do know what all women should most desire! [<i>There
is an expectant hush, as he pauses impressively.</i>] To be
pleasing in the eyes of their lords! [<i>This provokes laughter,
though some gentlemen seem to agree with the
speaker.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Sir Bleoberis.</span></p>

<p>To be richly beseen, Madam; to be arrayed with the
goodliest guise, in silk attire, with precious stones, perfumes
of sweet savour, and gold and silver, great plenty,
for to spend!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>This is received with amusement, and protest from

<p class="direction">[<i>More mirth, and renewed protests. Cries of: “Fie

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Sir Meliogrance.</span></p>

<p>Madam, I hold that all women in their hearts crave flattery,
fair words and sooth, on the tongue of men! [<i>This
also provokes mirth, and some protest, whereupon the
<span class="smcap">Knight</span> turns on the Ladies.</i>] Aye, and is there one

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Guinevere.</span></p>

<p>Now we know wherefore the shield of Sir Meliogrance

[<i>Looks about the group.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Several Ladies.</span></p>

<p>Sir Gawayne! Sir Gawayne has not spoken!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Sir Gawayne.</span></p>

<p>Now by the faith of my body should I be acquitted of
answer! [<i>This is greeted with cries of, “And wherefore,
Sir Knight?” on which <span class="smcap">Sir Gawayne</span> explains, addressing
himself to the <span class="smcap">Queen</span>.</i>] Madam, by your own ordinance
was not a quest of these ladies set upon me, for my dolorous
mishap whereby I slew a lady, smiting off her head!...
And by their judgment am not I upon covenant to
be courteous to all ladies and to fight for their quarrels

<p class="direction">[<i>This is received with some amusement and with general
assent to the justice of the plea.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Guinevere.</span></p>

<p>So then, my good Lord! [<i>She takes the parchment
from the <span class="smcap">Scribe</span> and hands this to the <span class="smcap">King</span>.</i>] Seal with
your signet and let send to the churlish knight these true

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Arthur.</span></p>

<p>Alas, good dame! All these answers and more did I
make incontinent, out of my own wit and with such simple
cunning as it hath pleased Heaven to grant me. But....
[<i>He sighs.</i>]</p>

<p>Labour lost and in vain! [<i><span class="smcap">All</span> exclaim, amazed.</i>] For
all my pains, the outrageous wight put great rebukes and
mockage on me, and made sport at me, and miscalled me
fool! [<i>This produces a profound sensation.</i>] And, an I
bring him the true rede or ever I set me down to meat upon
All-Hallowmass, my life is forfeit to him, and my lands,

never was no king that had so noble knights and valiant
as have I? But this is no matter for deeds of arms! For
did I not carry my sword Excalibur, the which is the

<p>The curtains have parted slowly, noiselessly, disclosing
a room in such deep shadow that only by peering can one
discern three small white beds far up against the wall of
a real everyday nursery, a companionable fire purring on
the hearth, and a real everyday Mother, the kind every
happy child knows, sitting singing. When her song is
ended she rises, bends over the pillows, nods as if satisfied
that, though three soft, warm little bodies lie snugly
tucked in between sheets and blankets, the Children themselves
have gone off on their nightly journey, to Sleep,
smoothes a coverlet in the quite unnecessary way that
Mothers have, draws a screen about the beds to keep out
the draught that grown-ups always think is trying to get
at children, but that in reality could not be coaxed to stay
in a house with all outdoors to play in, then, going to
the hearth, she seizes the poker, and in a fashion rather
violent for so gentle a being, she beats the reddest of the
logs until it sneezes sparks, as if to caution it against
breaking out in greedy flames that make everything within
reach catch fire like measles. Finally, since there is not
the least, wee excuse for further lingering, she kisses her
hand to the forms of the Children who by this time are
very far away, and steals noiselessly from the room.</p>

<p>The fire goes out with a disgruntled pop, as if remarking
that it has no desire to remain where it is not trusted
to behave itself, and the room becomes so dark you think
it is all over, and that it is not much of a play after all,
when, hark! You hear the jingle of sleigh-bells, and
the laughter of a merry party passing by. Now the warm
glow returns slowly to the hearth and the logs start talking.
“Crack, crack! Splutter, splutter,” cries one, turning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
its torch in the direction of the book-shelves.
“What’s all this learned nonsense? Works on botany, and
what’s that long word? Yes, ornithology! Why don’t
they say birds and beasts and flowers and forests and
things? And why go to books to learn when one has
eyes and ears ... five senses, all told, and a sixth, if
people did but know it!”</p>

<p>“Stupid as a log,” cries another. “That’s what I overheard
a teacher call a boy whose poor little body was kept
in a school-room while its soul had its arms about my neck,
learning True History, and the Real Meaning of Things,
in the forest! For my part, at the risk of seeming vain
I consider a log the brightest thing I know!”</p>

<p>“Right, O,” concurred a third. “Really human beings
are the dullest creatures! probably because someone invented
words for them to talk with! Now if you’re seeking
a professor of language let me recommend the head
of the squirrel family that used to be my top-front lodgers.
He could chatter more fluently about a hazel-nut
without articulating a single word than any human that
has addled his brains getting an University diploma!”</p>

<p>“True,” replied the first speaker. “And the longer humans
live in the world the duller they become from read—read—reading,
and talk—talk—talking words, words,
words, words, words! Now take babies. Babies are the
wise ones. Babies who cheep like birds when pleased and
squeal the way little pigs do when they are hungry can always
be depended on to make their meaning understood!
Nobody has to consult a dictionary or employ an interpreter
to hold a conversation with a baby in any language!
Old people, too, when they lose their teeth and forget<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
words, they grow wise again! What a pleasure it is to
burn brightly for old people as they sit beside the hearth,
warming their hearts, and telling them over and over again
the forgotten tales they heard from us before their wits
were cluttered up with words like rank growths of underbrush
in the forest!”</p>

<p>All paused a moment to reflect on this fine sentiment,
when a log at the back of the pile that had hitherto held
itself aloof, rolled up in a ragged cloak of charred bark,
now turned over with a snort, falling on the others heavily.
“The forest, indeed! Landlubbers all! I have been
to sea! I have been shipwrecked! I have stood on my
head and turned somersaults in mid-ocean!” And he
stuck out his tongue, sending forth darts of the most
wonderful green and blue. Thoroughly roused now, the
logs all talk at the same time, bragging of their adventures
and of the family trees from which they have sprung,
and there’s no knowing how it would end if it were not
that some people passing sing a snatch of an old Christmas
Carol, a great favourite with the hearth-logs, so that
they cease wrangling to listen to it.</p>

<p>Now there is dead silence in the nursery which soon is
filled with a strange light made up of hearth-glow, moon-beam
and the blueness that only comes from fairyland.
For the first time you notice that the Children have hung
their stockings from the mantelpiece. Then you see,
asleep on the hearthrug, three small brown beings, each
cuddling a broom, by which token you know them to be
the Good Little People who make their home with happy
Children, called Lobs for short, though if ever you address
one by his full title you’ll say Lob-Lie-By-The-Fire.</p>
